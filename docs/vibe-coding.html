                    <p>Vibe coding is an AI-assisted programming approach where you describe what you want in natural language, and the AI generates the code.</p>
                    <p>I'm Artur Nowak, and I built Augmatic GRE this way. The whole plugin was created through my natural-language prompts, while the AI wrote the actual C++ and <a href="https://juce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JUCE</a> code.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>When I first heard about vibe coding, I was skeptical. After doing it, I'm even more skeptical. The spark came from watching my son Leon build a speedcubing timer app with AI. I thought, "Okay&hellip; maybe this isn't a fairy tale." Augmatic GRE is dedicated to him. I love you Leon!</p>

                <section>
                    <p>I've been using music software for a long time &mdash; over 20 years with <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/reaktor-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Native Instruments Reaktor</a> (RIP?) and more recently <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max</a> &mdash; so I wasn't starting from zero. I already knew what PPQ was, at least.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy making music on the iPad, and I always had fun tweaking <a href="https://pichenettes.github.io/mutable-instruments-documentation/modules/grids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mutable Instruments Grids</a> patterns in <a href="https://vcvrack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VCV Rack</a> inside <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ableton Live</a>. But there was no Grids port for iPad. <a href="https://mirack.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miRack</a> is an option, but my Grids patch eventually became too large to use on iPad Mini inside <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drambo/id1469365718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drambo</a>.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>So I thought: why not make my own Grids port for the iPad? Despite my experience, I was naive enough to tell the AI, "Let's build Grids." It was supposed to be simple&hellip; and then I kept adding more ideas to make the rhythms more exciting.</p>

                    <p>Vibe coding sounds easy: tell the AI what you want, and it builds it. Apps on demand, right? Yeah, but not really. This project took many evenings and weekends over six months. I lost count of how many times the AI got stuck, confidently declared "this will work," and then absolutely did not work. That's where my Reaktor/Max background saved me: I had to design proper solutions myself, then instruct the AI to implement them. At one point I nearly asked it to build ~phasor from scratch. I know, I could use <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/rnbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RNBO</a>&hellip; maybe I will use it for the next project. I have many ideas and instruments in Reaktor which I would love to turn into self-contained plugins!</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Augmatic GRE turned out well enough that I decided to release it. <a href="../src/">The code is open</a>, so <a href="https://juce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JUCE</a> developers can have a good laugh and explain why AI won't replace them anytime soon. They'll be right.</p>
                    <p>I hope Augmatic GRE inspires you to create exciting rhythms and tracks. That's all I wanted for myself. <code>#makeyourownplugins</code></p>
